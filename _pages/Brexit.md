## Brexit harms

A local business recently wrote a letter describing how an export that used to cost £95 to send and take 5 minutes to arrange, now costs £400 and takes a whole afternoon to organise. He stressed that these are not teething problems they are a direct result of the way that the UK has left the single market and customs union.

Meanwhile Chester for Europe reports the harm that has been done to a cheese exporter.
