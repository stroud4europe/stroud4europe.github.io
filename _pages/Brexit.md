## Brexit harms

A local business recently wrote a letter describing how an export that used to cost £95 to send and take 5 minutes to arrange, now costs £400 and takes a whole afternoon to organise. He stressed that these are not teething problems they are a direct result of the way that the UK has left the single market and customs union.

Meanwhile Chester for Europe reports the harm that has been done to a cheese exporter.

Professor Daniel Kelemen has a useful twitter thread keeping track of at red tape and other problems caused by the implementation of Brexit at [Daniel Kelemen](https:/twitter.com/rdanielkelemen/status/1348964732104007680).

Yorkshire Bylines breaks down some of the issues into direct job losses at [The Digby Jones index](https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/the-digby-jones-index/) - named because Sir Digby Jones said that not a single job would be lost through voting to leave the EU.

Other problems including damage to business and the many losses of personal rights and freedoms being suffered by people in the UK are listed in the [Davis Down Side Dossier](https://yorkshirebylines.co.uk/the-davis-downside-dossier/) - named after David Davis, the then Brexit secretary, who told the House of Commons in October 2016 that *“there will be no downside to Brexit at all, and considerable upsides”*
