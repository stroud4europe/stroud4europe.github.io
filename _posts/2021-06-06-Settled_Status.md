[Stay European](https://www.stayeuropean.org/) are warning that
there is now less than a month to go until the Settled Status deadline on 30
June. Settled Status is what gives EU citizens living in Britain the right to
stay here after Brexit â€“ but only if they apply before the deadline.

This is a huge issue because any EU citizen who has not applied will lose their
rights. For example, they will [lose free NHS healthcare](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/26/eu-citizens-who-miss-settled-status-cut-off-will-immediately-lose-free-uk-healthcare) straight away. Soon they
will start to find it difficult to work, difficult to get a place to live, and
difficult to cross the border into Britain.

We can't let this happen to our European friends. We need to make a lot of noise
to make sure people know this deadline is approaching. Many people still have
not heard about the scheme or the deadline.

[The form to apply is here](https://apply-to-visit-or-stay-in-the-uk.homeoffice.gov.uk/euss). It works OK for most people, but there can be
technical difficulties, issues with a lack of documents (or expired documents),
bureaucratic screw-ups by the government and other problems.

If you need help, contact the dedicated charity [Settled](https://settled.org.uk/en/) who are doing an amazing
job. And if you would like to help Settled, you can [donate](https://settled.org.uk/en/donate/) or [volunteer](https://settled.org.uk/en/volunteer/).
