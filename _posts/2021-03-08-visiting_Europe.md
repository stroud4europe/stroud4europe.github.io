**Visiting Europe – post Brexit**

The list below highlights how things have changed and what you need to
check up on.

For further details, the latest advice and quick access to links, visit:

https://www.gov.uk/visit-eu-switzerland-norway-iceland-liechtenstein.

**Passports** must have 6 months left to run (except when visiting
Ireland)

**Health Insurance**

-   EHIC/GHIC To get reduced and sometimes free health care in EU
    countries you can use your existing European Health Insurance Card
    (EHIC )until it expires. We recommend checking the date on the card.
    EHIC is being replaced by a Global Health Insurance Card with
    similar benefits – you apply online.
-   The government recommends you also take out travel insurance.

**Border controls -** You may need to:

-   show a return or onward ticket
-   show you have enough money for your stay
-   use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens when queueing

**Visas** - not required for a tourist stay of less than 90 days.

What can’t you take into the EU?

-   meat or products containing meat
-   milk or dairy products
-   fresh fruit (apart from bananas, coconuts, dates, pineapples and
    durians)
-   vegetables
-   plants
-   plant products

**Taking your vehicle?**

You need a [green
card](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad) and a [GB
sticker](https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-symbols-and-identifiers).

Some countries also insist on an international driving permit

**Pet travel**

You can’t use the existing pet passport scheme. You’ll need an animal
health certificate (AHC) for your pet. Allow at least 1 month to arrange
this and relevant vaccinations.

**Free mobile roaming?** Check with your phone operator
