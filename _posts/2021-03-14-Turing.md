[The Turing scheme](https://www.turing-scheme.org.uk/) is the UK’s new global
programme to study and work abroad; replacing the EU funded Erasmus +
programme.

The ERASMUS scheme was set up in 1987 to foster links between schools, colleges, and universities across the 37 countries involved, mostly by funding and facilitating exchange visits. There are currently over 5,000 higher institutions participating in the Erasmus Program  and over 6 million students have been a part of it. In
[2019](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/factsheets/factsheet-uk-2019_en.html)
18,305 UK students benefitted from Erasmus grants to study or work in
another EU country. The Turing scheme plans to increase this number.

While colleges, businesses and universities are disappointed the
government chose to leave the Erasmus + programme they welcome the
opportunity to apply for Turing funding. They also have concerns,
including:

  - As a reciprocal scheme, Erasmus + enabled universities to waive
    tuition fees. ***Will overseas universities be willing to enter into
    the same agreements with the UK under Turing?***

  - Turing is “global” – as indeed will Eramus + be shortly. ***If fewer
    students choose to go to other European countries, what impact will
    this have on modern language learning in the UK?***

  - Students from other EU countries working and studying in the UK not
    only share their culture, skills and energy but spend some
    [£420 million a
    year](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/Losing-study-abroad-scheme-would-blow-a-hole-in-UK-economic-prospects.aspx).
    ***Leaving Erasmus is predicted to substantially reduce the number of
    students coming to the UK.***

  - Visitors to the UK now require passports and health insurance. ***Will
    these extra costs and bureaucracy deter students from choosing to
    come to the UK?***

  - Recipients of Turing funding need to be aware that visa free stays
    in EU member states are normally limited to 90 days in a six month
    period. ***Rules for student visa waivers for students vary between
    countries.***

  - [Erasmus+ offers
    placements](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/overview_en#tab-1-0)
    for teaching and college staff and youth workers as well as
    students, enabling valuable sharing of best practice Europe wide.
    ***The Turing scheme will not.***

  - The Turing programme has funding of £110m for 2021/22. ***It is not
    currently funded after that.***

## What can Stroud do?

Stroud4Europe are hoping to set up a bursary programme to support Stroud young
people to undertake study or work in other European countries. This could be as
a supplement to Turing funding.

*We would like to hear from employers and other
potential benefactors interested in contributing and/or taking part in this.*

*Have you benefited from an Erasmus experience? Please let us know.
