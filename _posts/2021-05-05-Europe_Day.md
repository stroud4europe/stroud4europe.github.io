## Europe Day Sunday 9 May


Stay European campaigns to regain the rights that UK citizens have lost, resist the effects of Brexit and rejoin the EU - [Stay European](https://www.stayeuropean.org/). It has produced some suggestions for things to do to celebrate Europe day which is an annual day of celebrating peace and unity across the continent:  



The date commemorates the Schuman declaration, which set out the idea that Europe should have a whole new era of political cooperation after the end of the Second World War.

After Brexit, for us who will always see ourselves as Europeans, this day is perhaps more significant this year than before. 

Stay European has put together a few ideas for things you can do at home or socially distanced with family or friends to celebrate your European identity this Europe Day. 


## European picnic

If the weather is looking decent where you are, why not plan a day in the park with some of your favourite European food items? Danish pastries, Polish poppy seed rolls, French cheeses, German sausages, Spanish wine… You get the idea – this is definitely the best-tasting way of celebrating Europe Day. 

Having a European picnic is also a lovely nod to the 1989 ‘Pan-European picnic’, a 1989 peace demonstration held on the Austrain-Hungarian border which marked the beginning of the end for the Iron Curtain.

If you want to add a new culinary delicacy to your European picnic, why not take a look at this [list of 50 traditional dishes](https://www.farandwide.com/s/europe-traditional-food-bf3982a5f9c44ca8) from all over the continent?


## European film night

A wealth of films have been produced in Europe over the last century, and with online streaming services it is easier than it’s ever been to discover new ones wherever you happen to be. 

Alternatively, you could take this opportunity to rediscover some of your old European film favourites on DVD.
