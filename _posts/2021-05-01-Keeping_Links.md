The majority of the British public are pro international links according to recent research from Best for Britain.
Best for Britain, created in 2017, has transitioned from being a temporary campaign against Brexit to being a permanent organisation for internationalist values and working with the world.  They have evidence that this is what the majority of the British population support.

To quote from their CEO, Naomi Smith;s  recent relaunch speech:
"The results (of our survey) show that views on Britain’s international role don’t divide neatly along the old Leave/Remain fracture lines; far from it.

Not only that, on key issues there is overwhelming agreement from both sides on the importance of close international relations. For example:

79% of people want the UK to work with international bodies to tackle climate change; 78% to tackle the pandemic, and 76% to deal with threats from Russia and China.

81% support cooperating with international bodies on science and research, rising to 91% of 2019 Conservative voters

79% of Remain voters and 72% of Leave voters support countries working together to regulate social media companies

And there is overwhelming support for international cooperation across the UK by region, gender, age group, ethnicity and political outlook
In other words, when you strip away the divisive shell of Brexit, Britons are inherently internationalist."
