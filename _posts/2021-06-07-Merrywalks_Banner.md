## Willkommen, Benvenuti, Croeso, Witamy!  

Four of the words of welcome on the multilingual banner displayed on Merrywalks Bridge during most of June.

The eye catching speech bubbles design was the prize winning work of
South Gloucestershire and Stroud (SGS) College Art, Design and Communication
student Sophie Steadman who combines a keen interest in digital design with
language learning. She is currently studying Japanese and Korean in her spare
time.

SGS students were invited to submit entries for the “Welcome to Stroud”
banner by organisers, Stroud4Europe.  

SGS Work Placement Coach Nicole Ince, who
coordinated the college entries, saw the competition as an ideal, meaningful
work experience opportunity and challenge, requiring social interaction
(virtual), analysis of target audience and working to a deadline whilst giving
students increased motivation to extend their design skills.

Runners up were Alexandra Rychvalska and Shannon Frankcom.  Alexandra’s globe image came from her analysis of Stroud
as being a place of open-minded, creative people from a variety of ethnicities living in a place with lots of nature.

Shannon explored a variety of images
including circles,

trees,

and flags.

This was the first time she had used digital
art for her work.

Stroud4Europe was really impressed with the students’
enthusiasm, imagination and commitment.  

Thanks to Stroud Town Council and Wheatley Printers in Thrupp for their advice on the display and production of the banner.
