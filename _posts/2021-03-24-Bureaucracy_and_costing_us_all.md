## Expensive Bureaucracy!
A local print maker told us "I sent a print to a friend in Holland as a gift (I am an artist-printmaker). It was posted with Parcelforce and was not cheap to post. He (my friend) received a note from his local post office to say that he needed to call in person to collect the print. In order to get the print, he had to pay a customs duty of 50 euro on a print that I’d valued at £100 on the customs declaration form.
This indicates that we cannot send presents by post to Europe without the recipient having to (in effect) purchase the package.  

Is this really what people voted for?"
