# Could you help us to:

- **Identify and develop existing European links in Stroud District** e.g twinning groups, exchange groups, friendship groups.  We are planning to set up a bursary scheme to support Stroud young people to work or study in EU countries.

- **Help establish relationships with local companies and organisations** that might support such bursaries and/or host European visitors.

- Work with other Supporters to **devise a strategy for supporting EU nationals** to apply for Settled Status.

- **Help Stroud4Europe set up this website**. Anyone with experience of designing and/or maintaining a website please get in touch.
