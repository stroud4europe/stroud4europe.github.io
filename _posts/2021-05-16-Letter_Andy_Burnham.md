## [The New European](https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news/westminster-news/andy-burnham-on-embracing-brexit-7967260) reported that the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has said the UK must "draw a line" under Brexit and instead focus on keeping the Union together 

*Ginie Moss of Cheltenham4Europe has written to him in response:*


Dear Mr Burnham, 

I have read recently that you had declared we should ’embrace brexit’. After being very impressed by the stand you took for your city against Johnson and the Tories, I must admit that I feel very let down about your statement. 

Is your declaration some sort of political move? If brexit is just a game for politicians, for so many of us, it is not. It is about our livelihoods; it has been an emotional rollercoaster that has rocked our lives for nearly 5 years and will carry on to do so. Many of us, if not lucky anymore to have retained our citizenship, feel European. This is what makes us who we are.  

I fought brexit tooth and nail and I feel disappointed when people in power, and more especially in the Opposition, who should make a stand, destroy all my hard work and effort. I will keep on making a stand against it and expose its negative impact. Why don’t you?  

In your comment, who exactly were you trying to lure?  

Mancunians, who voted 60.4% to Remain? 

Deprived people in our society who already suffer a great deal and whose lives will be even tougher? 

Ex Labour Supporters, who still voted Labour in 2019 to counter the Tories, in the hope to stop brexit? 

Other political parties’ supporters, who voted tactically in 2019 in the sole aim to stop brexit? 

People like me, my family and friends, who joined the Labour Party to have a vote in its new leadership and now feel abandoned?  

My friends on the campaign, all over the country, who have demonstrated against  brexit and spoken up about its dangers? 

Musicians, whose industry is being destroyed by brexit? 

Artists, who will have to try to beat new restrictions and harmful brexit barriers? 

Florists, affected by the devastating effects of leaving the EU which may have been missed due to Covid? 

Fishermen, who now feel betrayed? 

Older people, some of whom dreamt to retire in an EU country? 

People who look and sound different, like me, and who have been victims of xenophobic, racist comments because brexit Britain tolerates this sort of behaviour? 

UK citizens in the EU, who are feeling trapped and abandoned? 

EU citizens in the UK, who have felt the emotional impact of brexit so hard and feel like foreigners now?  

My husband, and other spouses of EU citizens, who have been stripped of their EU rights? 

My language students and young people in general, who will not have the chance to travel, live, love and work in Europe like we did?  

All the people I am forgetting to list and who will, one day or another, will feel the impact and realise what we have lost?  

Brexit is a Tory idea so why did you proclaim such a sad thing? Were you not very much attached to your EU rights and freedom of movement? This freedom certainly helped me settle in your country,  marry the man I love (a Brit) and choose to go back to France to give birth to my children on the Continent.  

Thankfully, my three children have retained their EU citizenship and will not suffer the disastrous consequences of that vote 5 years ago as much as their British friends. Rather than embracing brexit, you should expose its flaws – just like I have done for so many years now, as a Committee member of a pro-EU grassroots organisation, and as an immigrant who do not recognise a country that welcomed me some 22 years ago and that I have loved so much.  

I am looking forward to your reply - hopefully not that of a politician, but that of someone with common sense and emotional intelligence.

Ginie Moss
