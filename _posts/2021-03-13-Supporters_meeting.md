“Is P.R. the way to get closer to our European neighbours?”    At the next Supporters’ meeting – Monday March 29th 7.30 on zoom - a local independent activist, Geoff Gibbons - will lead a discussion on the influence pro-European groups can have on our future relationships with the EU.  Please join us.

 

The meeting will also introduce the new Stroud4Europe website, discuss the local impact of Brexit and report on the work we have been doing to encourage EU nationals to apply for Settled Status.
