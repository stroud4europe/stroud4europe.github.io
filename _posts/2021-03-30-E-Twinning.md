## What is E-Twinning

eTwinning:

- Allowed children of all abilities and all social and financial backgrounds **to build cross border friendships and broaden their horizons**,
- **Assisted language learning at an early age**, when children are most receptive,
- Provided a **safe platform for work and collaboration,**
- Offered teachers high quality **Continued Professional Development.**
**None** of this is in the Government's Turing Scheme.

We call on the Government to rectify this situation, by enabling the UK to participate as an eTwinning+ country (for countries outside of the European Union), so our children are not deprived of the opportunities it provides.


I cannot begin to capture in this blog the amazing cultural and educational value of eTwinning for students like mine, but here are just a few reasons why we need to take action and rejoin Erasmus+ eTwinning now:  

- It allowed children of all abilities and all social and financial backgrounds to build cross- border friendships and broaden their horizons, 
- Assisted language learning at an early age, when children are most receptive, 
- Offered hard-working teachers an amazing opportunity to enrich their own careers and learn from European counterparts.
