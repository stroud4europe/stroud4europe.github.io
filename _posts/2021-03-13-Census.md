As census day approaches on March 21st you can join thousands of pro Europeans in identifying as "European".

When completing the "national identity" question you can tick "other" and write in "European" - in addition to ticking the relevant box for 'British', 'English', 'Welsh'  'Scottish', 'Northern Irish'
